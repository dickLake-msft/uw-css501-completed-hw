## Basic Git usage{: id=git-usage}

The quick and easy version for gitting ;) started
with this repository:

### Download the Git repo{: id=download}

  1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
  1. [Install git on your development machine](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  1. On your development machine, create a folder to
     hold the Git projects.
  1. Open the terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows)
     for your machine.

     * Mac: Click Launchpad, type 'Terminal', click icon.
     * Windows: Search for 'cmd.exe', click result.

  1. Change directory into the new directory
     `cd my_new_dir`
  1. Clone (copy) the repo into your folder.
     `git clone https://github.com/telpirion/uw-css501-completed-hw.git`

To keep things simple, you'll also want to create a
branch of your own to work on. To create a branch,
run the following command, replacing bracketed content
as appropriate:

`git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>`

So, if your name is Joan Smith, you would use the
following command:

`get checkout -b Joan_Smith`
